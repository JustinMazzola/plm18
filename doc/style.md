# Style


ehtosa: authority dont u know who i a my fatehr is the king
       your suerpvosirs told us we could go here
    her's a piece of paper authorizing us
pathos: we're starving, come a long way
logos: anything to do with facts and figures and numbers and logic
     feeding oen os now means not having to feed all of us later
     if u let su thru, we will not sit here and eat all our food
violence: move it and we'll blast you
 note to implement the above, you ahve to invent a land with laws, where characters have back stories and motivations
and carry with them a world model of what they'll do in exchange for materials
