# The Game: Planet of the Puppies  (POP)

You and your team are walking the earth looking for puppies, which you will collect and retrn to home.
Points increase the faster more of your team bring home more pupiies.
Points decrease if (say), only one of you gets back, empty handed, after a very long time.

You can holler at strength 1 2 3 4 in which case 
all team members within some distance of you will start walking towards you at speeds 1 2 3 4 (and note that unnign at
speed, say, 2 consumes twice as much energy as walking at speed 1). If two team members are hollering
then everyone else heads towards the loudest (breaking ties at random).

Note that holeering is heard all over the earth (cause you actually holler via cell phone).

As you walk the earth, you leave behind footprints that never wash off. And the more people that walked some
spot, the deeper the footprints.
This means you can execute a tabu search (\*) or ant colony optimization (\*) to get more puppies home faster.

(\*) look it up.

Walking requires food (apples). Sometimes you come across fresh apples which if you eat, you can walk further.
Such apples grow X% per time T, spontaneaously in all the lowland countries.
Any apple bigger than 1 can be eaten. You can eat any whole number of that apple (and the rest remains for others).
If you run out of food,
you must sit still hoping another member of your team will find you and give you apples.

Puppies are fixed in number  at the start of the game and never create any more.
Some countries have lots of puppies, some have none. The occurence of puppy-less countries is spread
out evenly across the world.

The word has countries and in one country you can see all the doors to other countries, the depth of the
footsteps in this country, how many apples and puppies are found there and how many
team members in this country.
Ditto for any neighboring country 
connected by open doors.

Doors are controlled by gatekeepers
who you must meet
persaude to let you pass. That persaussian  takes one of 
five forms:

- Ethos: authority dont u know who i a my fatehr is the king
       your suerpvosirs told us we could go here
    her's a piece of paper authorizing us
pathos: we're starving, come a long way
logos: anything to do with facts and figures and numbers and logic
     feeding oen os now means not having to feed all of us later
     if u let osu thru, we will not sit here and eat all our food
kairos: "a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved."
  - might leve the gate open as thye, every seven days, walk intot he next country to go to church
  - of sleep
violence: move it and we'll blast you
 note to implement the above, you ahve to invent a land with laws, where characters have back stories and motivations
and carry with them a world model of what they'll do in exchange for materials

To get your team through a gate, you walk through and holler for them to follow you. Its up to you if you holler first
(to collect them) before trying to get teh door open, or afterwards.

Phase one: all doors are open, no gatekeepers, no clever search, just wonder at random.
