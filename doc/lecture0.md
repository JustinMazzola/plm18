Y'all yearning to be learning? Me too!

Education is the not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.    
-- W.Yeats

If the world merely lived up to our wildest dreamings, what a dull place it would be. Happily...    
-- Me

Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn.    
-- T.H. White (The Once and Future King)
