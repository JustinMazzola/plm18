Software is the tool we use to grasp and control the world. If our software can't grasp "it", we can't control "it"

So what is out of grasp for software? What can't it do?
Well, formally speaking, there is always something that cannot be expressed in software
(Godel). That said, well before we hit the Goedel limts, we strike many other limtiations.

Some of theose languages are built into the the very langauge we use to explore a problem. Bees have struggled with this for eons. When worker Western honey bees
return to the hive, they do a _waggle dance_ that tells ther birds direction and distance to a honey source.  Their language does not include any mention of hiehgt so if one bee stumbles over somethign sweet on top of a pole then, a few hours later, other bees will be seen innefectiveually buzing about the base of that pole going "hey sugar! where you at?"

The way we write our computer languages buases: what can we can quickly 
say and do in our programs. For example, the following two code fragments define a record in a programming
language. Which is easier to see and change the record structure?

erlang

Here is JAVAScript and a language called ELM, both attaching actions to events in a web browser. In which language would be it be easier to write new actions? Check old ones?

elm js

But the above are kinda small, toy examples. Is there anything more substantial I can offer to support this idea of better language = better modeling = better programs?
Well, as a matter of fact...

Once upon a time I was a snot-nosed know-all masters student being paid to be an "expert systems" consultant. You may have never heard of that job cause it as nine hype-cycles ago
(for the record: expert systems, ai, object-oriented, internet, ai (again), web, social, deep learning, blockchain).  I'd just been reading
about _knowledge chunking_ [Larkin80]; i.e. 

- How novices explore problems in a tedious brute force;
- Experts learn how to glance a problem, extract a small numnber of key features.

Since there are limits on the amount of information that people can hold in short-term memory, short-term memory is enhanced when people are able to chunk information into familiar patterns (Miller, 1956). (33. (chunking examples from chunking; chapter 11, p206). In each case, expertise in a domain helps people develop a sensitivity to patterns of meaningful information that are not available to novices.(33)

- Experts notice features and meaningful patterns of information that are not noticed by novices.
- Experts have acquired a great deal of content knowledge that is organized in ways that reflect a deep understanding of their subject matter.
- Experts’ knowledge cannot be reduced to sets of isolated facts or propositions but, instead, reflects contexts of applicability: that is, the knowledge is “conditionalized” on a set of circumstances.
- Experts are able to flexibly retrieve important aspects of their knowledge with little attentional effort.
